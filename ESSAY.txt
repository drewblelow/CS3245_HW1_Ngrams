1. In the homework assignment, we are using character-based ngrams,
i.e., the gram units are characters. Do you expect token-based ngram
models to perform better?



2. What do you think will happen if we provided more data for each
category for you to build the language models? What if we only
provided more data for Indonesian?



3. What do you think will happen if you strip out punctuations and/or
numbers? What about converting upper case characters to lower case?

The results will be language dependent. For example, in English, only the start of sentences and names are
in uppercase. For other languages such as German, many words have an uppercase first letter. In the case of
numbers, removing them would improve accuracy as they should not add to the probability of any language.

4. We use 4-gram models in this homework assignment. What do you think
will happen if we varied the ngram size, such as using unigrams,
bigrams and trigrams?

For many languages, there are certain letters which are used more than others. If we used unigrams, the
assignment would resemble a cryptanalysis assignment. Identifying the languages might still be feasible.
